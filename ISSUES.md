### Backend Issues

#### 1. **Timeout Handling in chat.py**
   - The `timeout_context` function uses `signal.SIGALRM`, which is not supported on Windows. If the backend is deployed on a Windows server, this will cause runtime errors.
   - **Fix**: Use a cross-platform timeout library like `concurrent.futures` or `asyncio` for timeout handling.

#### 2. **Global Variable in retrain.py**
   - The `last_retrain_time` variable is global, which can lead to race conditions if multiple requests are handled concurrently.
   - **Fix**: Use a thread-safe mechanism like a database or a cache (e.g., Redis) to store the last retrain time.

#### 3. **Hardcoded Cooldown in retrain.py**
   - The `RETRAIN_COOLDOWN` is hardcoded to 300 seconds. This might need to be configurable via environment variables.
   - **Fix**: Add `RETRAIN_COOLDOWN` to the .env file and load it dynamically.

#### 4. **Error Handling in model_runner.py**
   - Functions like `analyze_sentiment`, `detect_threat`, and `detect_sarcasm` raise generic `RuntimeError` exceptions. This can make debugging difficult.
   - **Fix**: Use custom exception classes for better error categorization.

#### 5. **Database Connection in logs.py**
   - The `SessionLocal` object is created for each database operation, but connections are not properly pooled or reused. This can lead to performance issues under heavy load.
   - **Fix**: Use a connection pool or a library like `sqlalchemy.pool.QueuePool`.

#### 6. **RabbitMQ Integration in logs.py**
   - The RabbitMQ connection is established and closed for every log streaming operation. This can be inefficient.
   - **Fix**: Use a persistent connection or a connection pool for RabbitMQ.

#### 7. **Environment Variable Defaults**
   - Several environment variables (e.g., `DATABASE_URL`, `AUTH_TOKEN`) lack proper validation or fallback mechanisms.
   - **Fix**: Validate environment variables at startup and provide meaningful error messages if they are missing.

#### 8. **Security in auth.py**
   - The `AUTH_TOKEN` is stored in plain text in the .env file. If the .env file is exposed, the token can be compromised.
   - **Fix**: Use a secure secret management system like AWS Secrets Manager or Azure Key Vault.

#### 9. **Dataset Path in retrain_script.py**
   - The `DATASET_PATH` is hardcoded to dataset.csv. If the path changes, the script will fail.
   - **Fix**: Validate the dataset path at runtime and provide a fallback mechanism.

#### 10. **Logging Configuration**
   - Logging is configured multiple times across files (e.g., chat.py, retrain.py). This can lead to inconsistent logging behavior.
   - **Fix**: Centralize logging configuration in a single module.

### Frontend Issues

#### 1. **Error Handling in page.tsx**
   - The `sendMessage` and `triggerRetrain` functions only log errors to the console. This can make debugging difficult for users.
   - **Fix**: Display detailed error messages in the UI.

#### 2. **Hardcoded API URL in SentimentGraph.tsx**
   - The `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is used directly without validation. If the environment variable is missing, the application will fail silently.
   - **Fix**: Add a fallback mechanism or validation for `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`.

#### 3. **Debounce in SentimentGraph.tsx**
   - The `debounce` function updates the graph data every second. If the data stream is very fast, some updates might be missed.
   - **Fix**: Use a more robust mechanism like throttling or batch processing.

#### 4. **EventSource Error Handling**
   - The `EventSource` connection in SentimentGraph.tsx closes on errors but does not attempt to reconnect.
   - **Fix**: Implement a retry mechanism for the `EventSource` connection.

#### 5. **UI Feedback for Loading State**
   - The `loading` state in page.tsx is only displayed as text. This might not be visually appealing.
   - **Fix**: Use a spinner or progress bar for better user experience.

### General Issues

#### 1. **Code Duplication**
   - Functions like `retry_with_timeout` in chat.py and `fetchWithRetry` in page.tsx have similar functionality but are implemented separately.
   - **Fix**: Refactor common functionality into shared utility modules.

#### 2. **Testing**
   - There is no evidence of unit tests or integration tests in the workspace.
   - **Fix**: Add tests for critical components like model_runner.py, auth.py, and page.tsx.

#### 3. **Documentation**
   - The workspace lacks documentation for APIs and components.
   - **Fix**: Add API documentation using tools like Swagger or Postman and component documentation using Storybook.

#### 4. **Deployment Configuration**
   - There is no deployment configuration (e.g., Dockerfile, Kubernetes manifests) in the workspace.
   - **Fix**: Add deployment scripts to ensure consistent environments across development, staging, and production.
