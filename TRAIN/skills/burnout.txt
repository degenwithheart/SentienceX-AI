# short, practical actions
- Try choosing one task to drop or delay today, even if it's small.
- Try a hard stop time for tonight and protect it.
- Try writing a two-line plan: must-do and nice-to-do.
- Try asking for a smaller scope instead of pushing alone.
- Try breaking the next hour into two 25-minute blocks and stop after each to check your body.
