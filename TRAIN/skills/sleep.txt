# short, practical actions
- Consider try writing down tomorrow's worries, then close the notebook.
- Try a gentle "brain dump" before bed to unload the loop.
- Try a short body scan from toes to jaw.
- Consider try a 10-minute wind-down with the lights dim and your phone out of reach.
- Consider try the same wake time for three days to stabilize it.
