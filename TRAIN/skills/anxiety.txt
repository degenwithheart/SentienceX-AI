- Try labeling the thought as a thought, not a fact.
- Try a small exposure step: one tiny action you can finish in 5 minutes.

- Consider try writing the worry down and circle what you can control today.
- Try a 60-second reset: name 5 things you see, 4 you feel, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste.
