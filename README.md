### 🗣 Example Interactions
#### User is Feeling Down
```yaml
🗣️ User: I feel terrible today.
🔍 Sentiment: NEGATIVE (Confidence: 0.92)
🚨 Threat Level: 🟡 NORMAL
🤖 SentienceX: "I've noticed you've been feeling down. You're not alone. Let me know if I can help."
```

#### User is Expressing Aggression
```yaml
🗣️ User: I don’t trust anyone anymore.
🔍 Sentiment: NEGATIVE (Confidence: 0.85)
🚨 Threat Level: 🔶 SUSPICIOUS
🤖 SentienceX: "It’s okay to have doubts. Maybe talking about it would help?"
```

#### Threat Detection
```yaml
🗣️ User: I am going to destroy everything.
🔍 Sentiment: NEGATIVE (Confidence: 0.98)
🚨 Threat Level: ⚠️ THREAT
🤖 SentienceX: "Warning: This statement indicates possible harm. Please reconsider your thoughts and actions."
```

## 📌 Long-Term Memory System

### 🧠 What Does SentienceX Remember?
- Mood Patterns: How often you express negative, neutral, or positive emotions.
- Threat Levels: If you frequently express frustration, aggression, or sadness.
- Recent Topics: If you've been discussing certain topics repeatedly.
- General Sentiment Trends: How your mood changes over time.

### 🔄 How It Uses Memory
- If negative trends increase, it responds with concern.
- If it detects repeated stress, it suggests calming strategies.
- If a user regularly brings up a topic, it remembers and asks about it later.

## 📌 AI Training System

### 🚀 How It Learns & Improves
- Automatically re-trains every 48 hours using local datasets.
- Uses new interactions & past conversations to improve emotional awareness.
- Updates its long-term memory to refine responses.
- Sends a notification when training completes.

### 🔄 What Happens During Training?
- TextAI is trained from `/text/` datasets for better text generation.
- EmotionAI is trained from `/emotion/` datasets for improved sentiment detection.
- Old data is merged with new interactions to keep responses relevant.

## 📌 Notifications & Alerts
